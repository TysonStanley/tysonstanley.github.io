I currently manage a team of researchers at Highmark Health, an integrated health system, working as a methodologist/data scientist on projects relating to the quintuple aim of healthcare: 1) improving patient experience, 2) improving population health, 3) reducing costs, 4) improving care team well-being, and 5) increasing health equity.


I also work on projects relating to communication disorders and health, teaming up with the talented Stephanie Borrie, PhD tackling many issues in the field.

I am enthusiastic about the `R` Programming Environment and seek to develop user-friendly tools that simplify the use, the interpretation, or the application of current and novel data analytic methods. 

Regarding my blog, I'll post on this site with R tutorials regarding data analytics and visualizations and to introduce great functions and features that can make working with data a bit more pleasant, including about packages and functions that I have written.

You can find my CV here: [Tyson S. Barrett]({{ site.baseurl }} /assets/CV/CV.pdf). You can also follow me on [Twitter]({{ site.author.url }}) or you can find my repos at [GitHub]( {{ site.github.repo }} ). Feel free to email me at <t.barrett@aggiemail.usu.edu> to discuss research ideas, R software development, or have questions about any of my posts.
