**Optional Resources:** 

-	R for Health, Behavioral, and Social Scientists, Tyson Barrett, available for free at: [https://tysonstanley.github.io/Rstats](https://tysonstanley.github.io/Rstats) (currently not the final draft)
- R for Data Science, Hadley Wickham, available for free at: [https://r4ds.had.co.nz](https://r4ds.had.co.nz)
- ModernDive, Chester Ismay & Albert Y. Kim, available for free at: [https://moderndive.com](https://moderndive.com)

**Class Objective:** <br>
This seminar/workshop will address the major uses of R for Health, Behavioral, Educational, and Social Scientists. This includes: managing data, reshaping data, exploratory and advanced plotting, functions, modeling, and automation. These will allow a student to use R to work with their own data and empower one to learn more advanced topics about R using available resources via various websites and books. Some statistical topics will be discussed in reference to R code but a full understanding of the methods is not required. The class will follow the format of the R for Health, Behavioral, and Social Scientists book.

**Structure:** <br>
The class will be hands-on, with most of class going through the R code together. The last 10 to 15 minutes of class will be devoted to allowing students to work with their own data. The class will be divided into three main sections:

1. Creating Your Own Functions
2. Loops and Other Automation
3. More Advanced Data Manipulation and Plotting

**Grading:** <br>
This is a pass/fail course. A student will be given a passing grade if they attend 5 of the 7 class times and turn in a final project. If passed, it will appear on your transcript as a completed continuing education workshop.

**Assignments:** <br>
There is only one graded assignment---a final project. This project will be developed throughout the class. It requires a written report with aspects from each main topics of the class (e.g., working with data, plotting, modeling). This will be discussed more throughout the class.

**Students with Disabilities:** <br> 
Reasonable accommodation will be provided for all persons with disabilities in order to ensure equal participation within the program. If a student has a disability that will likely require some accommodation by the instructor, the student must contact the instructor and document the disability through the Disability Resource Center (797-2444), preferably during the first week of the course. Any request for special consideration relating to attendance, pedagogy, taking of examinations, etc., must be discussed with and approved by the instructor. 

**Children in class:**

1. All breastfeeding children are welcome as often as necessary.
2. All non-nursing babies and children are welcome whenever alternate arrangements cannot be made. As a parent of three young children, I understand that babysitters fall through, partners have conflicting schedules, children get sick, and other issues arise.
3. In cases where children come to class, I invite parents/caregivers to sit close to the door so as to more easily excuse yourself to attend to your child's needs. As such, it is great if those seats are left available for any parents.
4. All students are expected to join with me in creating a welcoming environment that is respectful of your classmates' situations.

**Inclusivity:**

Professional courtesy and sensitivity are especially important with respect to individuals and topics dealing with differences of race, culture, religion, politics, sexual orientation, gender, gender variance, and nationalities. It is expected that all students will make all efforts to keep the classroom an inclusive environment. 

*Note: I will gladly honor your request to address you by an alternate name or gender pronoun. Please advise me early in the semester so that I may make appropriate changes to my records.*
