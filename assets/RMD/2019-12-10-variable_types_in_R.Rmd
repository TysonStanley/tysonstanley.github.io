```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

Some lessons from the weird stuff that can happen in R.

## Factors are actually integers with attributes

Consider the example (as shown on the [`vctrs` package README]()):

```{r}
c(factor("a"), factor("b"))
```

How would that ever be a possible answer? Is it a bug? Well, the behavior is actually somewhat expected, even if it is not what the user likely wants (and even though there probably should be a warning message with it).

It is predictable, because both `factor("a")` and `factor("b")` are integers with some extra information (called attributes) that tell it what the level means.

```{r}
str(factor("a"))
attributes(factor("a"))
```


```{r}

```
